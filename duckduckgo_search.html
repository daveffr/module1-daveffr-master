        <h3>CSE 330 Regrade Policy</h3>
        <p>It must be objectively clear that an error was made during grading. Examples of such errors include a 
            grader incorrectly summing points or incorrectly marking something not completed. Grades based on the 
            judgment of the grader, except in extremely extenuating circumstances, will not be regraded. In 
            particular, grades for categories like "Site is Visually Appealing" will not be regraded. All regrade 
            requests must be submitted by using the form posted on Piazza. Students will have one week to submit 
            their regrade request. Requests submitted after this deadline will not be considered. Requests must 
            contain a specific explanation of the error, including filenames and line numbers of code, if 
            appropriate.</p>
